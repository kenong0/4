In 2019, the traditional fossil fuels sectors employed 1.2 million americans. However, this is still too low. Wind and solar creates about 13.5 jobs per million dollars of spending, and that building retrofits — energy efficiency — creates 16.7 jobs … Depending on what you want to do, explore degree options in chemistry, bioinformatics, chemical engineering and environmental policy. 1 day ago · by 2030, solar jobs are expected to almost double to about 400,000, and could reach 900,000 for the u.s. Over 3 million americans were employed by the clean energy sector as of 2020.
